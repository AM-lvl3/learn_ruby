# You should be in the folder 00_hello on the command line, 
# and you should run the tests right now by entering
# $ ruby hello.rb 

# You should get an error saying "cannot load such file -- ./hello.rb (LoadError)"
# That error is coming from the line below (line #7)â€“
require "./hello.rb"
# To stop this error from being thrown we need to create the file:
# $ touch hello.rb 

require "test/unit" # this gets us the testing framework we want 

# Now if we run the tests again, it will complain about "a undefined local variable or method `hello'"
# Let's keep this in mind while we go through the next little bit of code.

# The line below is not important to us
class The_Hello_Function < Test::Unit::TestCase
  def test_says_hello
    # Line #21 is saying: if we call the method hello, what it returns should be equal to "Hello!"
    # If that's not the case, this is a failing test.
    assert_equal "Hello!", hello
    # So in hello.rb let's define a method named hello,
    # and let's make it return "Hello!"

    # In hello.rb:
    # 
    # def hello
    #   return "Hello!"
    # end
  end
end

# Congrats, if all went well, we made our first test ever pass!

# But hold on there cowboy, we got another test right in front of us now.

class The_Greet_Function < Test::Unit::TestCase
  def test_says_hello_to_someone
    assert_equal "Hello, Alice!", greet("Alice")
  end

  def test_says_hello_to_someone_else
    assert_equal "Hello, Bob!", greet("Bob")
  end

  # These two tests are saying there should be a method named greet
  # that takes in a string, and returns that string inside of another string, a hello greeting.
  # Again, the method has to be defined in hello.rb
  # Try see if you can get this test to pass!
end
